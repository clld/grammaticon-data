In linguistic terms, nouns are items which display certain types of inflection (e.g. of case or number), have a specific distribution (e.g. they may follow prepositions but not, say, modals), and perform a specific syntactic function (e.g. as subject or object of a sentence).

53,demonstrative,A demonstrative is a form other than a first or second person form that can help establish reference via egocentric spatial deixis.,,"Dixon (2003):

A demonstrative is here defined as a grammatical word (or, occasionally, a
clitic or affix) which can have pointing (or deictic) reference; for example This is my favourite chair (pointing at an object) or Put it there! (pointing at a place). It could be argued that 1st and 2nd person pronouns have, by their very nature, implicit pointing reference. In view of this, the definition of demonstrative can be modified to be “any item, other than 1st and 2nd person pronouns, which can have pointing (or deictic) reference”.

Diessel (2005, WALS):

""Demonstratives are deictic expressions such as English this and that. They indicate the relative distance of a referent in the speech situation vis-à-vis the deictic center. The deictic center, which is also called the origo, is roughly equivalent to the speaker’s location at the time of the utterance.""

Dryer (2005, WALS):

For the purposes of this map, a word or affix is considered a demonstrative if it satisfies at least one of two criteria: (1) it has among its uses a meaning that contrasts with some other form in terms of physical proximity to the speaker, so that there is at least a two-way contrast of proximal (near speaker) versus distal (not near speaker); or (2) the form has among its uses an indication that the hearer is intended to direct their attention towards something in the physical environment. In many and probably most languages, demonstratives are associated with both of these functions.

Diessel & Coventry (2020):

The term “demonstrative” refers to a small class of expressions that are commonly divided into two basic types: nominal demonstratives such as English this and that and adverbial demonstratives such as here and there (Dixon, 2003). The two types of demonstratives are closely related. They usually include the same deictic roots (Diessel, 1999) and are defined by two basic concepts of language and cognition, i.e., joint attention and deixis (Levinson, 2004; Diessel, 2014).

Wikipedia (2023):

Dear Jürgen (and Stephanie),

As you know, like David I keep asking questions about terminology, and I have the dream that one day, we will no longer be forced to ask such questions because we will have a standard morphosyntactic terminology, just as we have a standard set of phonological symbols (the IPA).

So my question is: If we want to have a standard definition of the term ""definite"", would the following work:?

""A definite nominal is a nominal whose referent is uniquely identifiable to the hearer because it is discourse-given or unique in the wider or immediate discourse context.""

This would be a comparative concept, and it would map (not always perfectly) onto various language-particular semantic categories (as you say). My definition does not mention ""discourse status"" (because I wouldn't know how to define this concept), and it talks about the ""hearer"" rather than the ""interlocutors"" because it seems that unique identifiability for the speaker plays no role (?).

Next, you use the terms ""particle"", ""function word"" and ""inflection"", but I'm not sure what exactly these mean. Would it be possible, instead, to use the term ""bound form"", i.e. a form that cannot occur on its own (= in isolation)? (see https://dlc.hypotheses.org/1779) Everyone agrees that ""inflectional markers"" cannot occur on its own, and this applies to most forms called ""particles"" as well (except for ""yes"", ""no"", and very few others). The most difficult concept is ""function word"" – but wouldn't you agree that definite articles are not expected to be free forms? It seems that in all languages, (at least some) demonstratives can occur on their own, while forms called ""definite articles"" can never occur in isolation.

If one had these definitions (which I'd hope would be widely acceptable), your question could be formulated as follows:

Are there glossed corpora of languages that lack bound forms that routinely mark definite nominals as definite?

(Or even more briefly: Are there glossed corpora of languages that lack a definite article? if ""definite article"" is defined as ""a bound form that routinely marks definite nominals as definite"".)

It seems to me that ""bound form"" is probably better suited than ""grammaticalized"", because this term is rather vague and there are a whole range of criteria that one might apply.

I'd be curious to hear what you think.

Best wishes,
Martin",,,,,,

##Or maybe pro-index should not be included???

Lingtyp 2021.07.07-ego:

Maybe the following will work:

""A personal pronoun is a free form that (i) denotes a speech role (speaker/producer and/or hearer/comprehender) OR that is used as an anaphoric form AND (ii) that can be used in a complement clause coreferentially with a matrix clause argument.""

This is a disjunctive definition that brings together locuphoric forms ('I', 'we', 'you') and 3rd-person anaphoric (or ""endophoric"") forms, following the Western tradition (but not following any kind of compelling logic).

It seems that personal pronouns need to be delimited from three types of somewhat doubtful forms:

– person indexes (I do not include bound forms under ""personal pronoun"" here, following my 2013 paper on person indexes: https://zenodo.org/record/1294059)
– demonstratives
– titles like ""Your Majesty""

I think that if a language has a form like ""that-one"" or ""your-majesty"" that can be used coreferentially in a complement clause, one will regard it as a personal pronoun:

(a) ""My sister(i) thinks that that-one(i) has an answer.""
(b) ""Does your-majesty(i) think that your-majesty(i) has an answer?""

In German, the polite second-person pronoun ""Sie"" (which has Third-Person syntax) can be used in (b), but the demonstrative ""die"" can hardly be used in (a), so it would not count as a personal pronoun (yet). However, in Hindi-Urdu and Mongolian, as mentioned by Ian, the demonstrative can be used in this way (I think), so it would count as a personal pronoun.

I don't think we need the general notion of ""person"" to define ""personal pronoun"". Wikipedia's current definition is therefore quite confusing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_pronoun).

Thanks for this interesting challenge, Ian! It seems to me that quite a few of our traditional terms CAN be defined, but their definitions are not obvious at all (and the textbooks don't usually give the definitions).

Martin",Personal Pronoun,http://linguistics-ontology.org/gold/2010/PersonalPronoun,"GOLD does not distinguish between independent personal pronouns and bound person forms. – ""A pronoun used to refer to the speaker, the person spoken to, and other persons and things whose referents are presumed to be clear from the context. While some personal pronouns in some languages occur in essentially the same sentence position as other nominal expressions, it is rather common for them to show distributional peculiarities. Personal pronouns may be clitics whose distribution may be consistently distinct from that of non-clitic nominals. It is also common for the equivalent of personal pronouns to be expressed by affixes on the verb. [Schachter 1985: 25-26]""",,,

104,interrogative pronoun,An interrogative pronoun is a form that occurs in a content question and that occupies the position of the open parameter at issue.,,"(LINGTYP Oct 2017)

This definition would comprise forms such as Italian ""cosa"" (which means 'what?' or 'thing'), as well as French ""que"" (which is a bound form, in that it cannot occur by itself). Perhaps these are not ""genuine"" interrogative pronouns, in the sense that they are free forms (like Latin ""quid?""), or in the sense that they only occur in an interrogative context (again like Latin ""quid?""). But since even the forms of well-known languages may occur in non-interrogative contexts (e.g. most English wh-pronouns, used in relative clauses), it does not seem reasonable to define ""interrogative pronoun"" in a narrow sense.

I do share the feeling that Abkhaz and Abaza are unusual in some way, but I'm not sure how best to express this with clear comparative concepts.

110,applicative marker,An applicative marker is a grammatical marker occurring on a verb that changes the verb's valency in such a way that an argument other than the P of the base verb gets to be coded like the P-argument in a simple transitive clause.,"""The effect of the applicative is to introduce a new internal argument into the argument structure of a verb. It thus allows a role that would be expressed as an oblique, if at all, to be expressed as a direct argument. The theta roles that the applicative can affect in this way are those which in many languages are expressed as obliques (adpositional or semantically case-marked phrases) and which are often optional arguments of the verb: beneficiaries, goals, instrumentals, etc."" (Alsina & Mchombo 1993: 27)

""Applicatives assign the status of direct object to oblique roles of different kinds. [...] The applicative transitivizes an intransitive verb, providing it with a direct object. If a transitive verb is extended by an applicative the original direct object [...] will normally give up its status. But there are instances [...] where the original patient retains its ability to become the subject of a passive even after applicative formation has taken place."" (Haspelmath & Müller-Bardey 2004: 1134)

""In terms of their morphosyntax, applicative constructions are constructions, or sentential structures, which involve a participant that normally would not be instantiated in a core object relation, but rather as an oblique of one or another sort, in a core (usually direct object) instantiation. There must be overt marking of the construction in the verbal complex [...]. The construction should also be highly productive across a significant portion of the verbal lexicon"" (Peterson 2007: 39)","There are various subtypes of applicative markers, depending on the role which they transform into a P-argument. Thus, for example, an instrumental applicative marker is an applicative marker that transforms a nominal with an instrumental role into a P-argument, and languages often have benefactive or comitative applicative markers.

Polinsky (2005), Peterson (2007) and Pacchiarotti (2017) offer general cross-linguistically informed discussions of applicatives, and Pacchiarotti's Chapter 2 has extensive discussion of the terminology.

Many authors think of applicative constructions as containing an additional ""direct object"" of some kind, and then the question of the cross-linguistic identification of ""direct object"" arises. The definition in terms of ""P-argument"" (= coded like the monotransitive P) solves this problem.

Some languages have object-adding markers that indicate the addition (or mere presence) of a different kind of ""object"", e.g. a dative or oblique object, or even an adpossessor of an object. Such constructions are not applicatives by the definition given here, though they are of course very similar to them and may be treated identically in particular languages.",,,,,,

158,applicative construction,(preliminary entry),,"Lingtyp:

I think the answer to Adam's question is that a construction is an applicative only if the new object is coded like the P-argument of a basic transitive construction.

Thus, Simon Musgrave's example (1c) from Taba (based on Bowden 2001) is an (instrumental) applicative:

npun-ak kolay peda
kill-APPL snake machete

But when the instrument 'machete' has its instrumental preposition (ada peda 'with a machete'), it is not an applicative, from a typological perspective (= as a comparative concept).

There is no ""official"" definition of the (typological) term ""applicative"", of course, but it is my understanding that most people use the term in this way. The Wikipedia article reflects this by speaking about promotion to ""(core) object"": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_voice.

(Maria Polinsky's WALS article is vague and speaks just about ""increasing the number of object arguments by one"", without making precise what is meant by ""object"", https://wals.info/chapter/109. But her examples and the discussion make it clear that she means objects coded like P-arguments.)

This does not mean, of course, that the description of Taba should not use the term ""Applicative"" for the suffix -ak in all cases – but this would be a language-specific descriptive category, somewhat like Dative is used in Russian-type languages also when the case in question is not used in its definitional function (recipient of 'give').",,,,,,

It seems to me that this example (Korean Hyeng-kwa hyeng-uy chinkwu 'older brother and his friend') should not be subsumed under ""anaphora"".

I think the term ""anaphoric form"" should probably be defined as follows:

An anaphoric form is a form which always receives its referential interpretation from another expression in the context.

(One might also say ""anaphor"" instead of ""anaphoric form"", but in generative grammar's ""binding theory"", anaphor is often used for a special subset of anaphoric forms.)

A noun or nominal which is not an anaphoric form is typically banned from being coreferential with another element in the same minimal clause (*Kim(1) went home with Kim(1)'s friend). But with titles and kinship terms, and in some languages also names, such coreference is often possible (e.g. Vietnamese
Đạti nghĩ là Đạti sẽ thắng [Dat think that Dat will win], Pham 2011: http://www.mikettpham.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kinship-terms-squib.pdf). So there is something special going on here.

Are such forms (which are not anaphoric forms by definitions) pronouns? This depends on how we define ""pronoun"", but I would think that pronouns should not be an open class. So we probably need some new terms here. Maybe something has been proposed in the literature on East/Southeast Asian languages?

Ian Joo:

Dear all,

is there a term for “non-pronominal anaphora”, i. e. using personal names or titles for anaphoric reference?

I tried to search it in Google, but since I don’t know what this phenomenon is called, I don’t know what to search for.
I would appreciate your help.
