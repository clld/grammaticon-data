Dixon (2003):

A demonstrative is here defined as a grammatical word (or, occasionally, a
clitic or affix) which can have pointing (or deictic) reference; for example This is my favourite chair (pointing at an object) or Put it there! (pointing at a place). It could be argued that 1st and 2nd person pronouns have, by their very nature, implicit pointing reference. In view of this, the definition of demonstrative can be modified to be “any item, other than 1st and 2nd person pronouns, which can have pointing (or deictic) reference”.

Diessel (2005, WALS):

""Demonstratives are deictic expressions such as English this and that. They indicate the relative distance of a referent in the speech situation vis-à-vis the deictic center. The deictic center, which is also called the origo, is roughly equivalent to the speaker’s location at the time of the utterance.""

Dryer (2005, WALS):

For the purposes of this map, a word or affix is considered a demonstrative if it satisfies at least one of two criteria: (1) it has among its uses a meaning that contrasts with some other form in terms of physical proximity to the speaker, so that there is at least a two-way contrast of proximal (near speaker) versus distal (not near speaker); or (2) the form has among its uses an indication that the hearer is intended to direct their attention towards something in the physical environment. In many and probably most languages, demonstratives are associated with both of these functions.

Diessel & Coventry (2020):

The term “demonstrative” refers to a small class of expressions that are commonly divided into two basic types: nominal demonstratives such as English this and that and adverbial demonstratives such as here and there (Dixon, 2003). The two types of demonstratives are closely related. They usually include the same deictic roots (Diessel, 1999) and are defined by two basic concepts of language and cognition, i.e., joint attention and deixis (Levinson, 2004; Diessel, 2014).

Wikipedia (2023):

Dear Jürgen (and Stephanie),

As you know, like David I keep asking questions about terminology, and I have the dream that one day, we will no longer be forced to ask such questions because we will have a standard morphosyntactic terminology, just as we have a standard set of phonological symbols (the IPA).

So my question is: If we want to have a standard definition of the term ""definite"", would the following work:?

""A definite nominal is a nominal whose referent is uniquely identifiable to the hearer because it is discourse-given or unique in the wider or immediate discourse context.""

This would be a comparative concept, and it would map (not always perfectly) onto various language-particular semantic categories (as you say). My definition does not mention ""discourse status"" (because I wouldn't know how to define this concept), and it talks about the ""hearer"" rather than the ""interlocutors"" because it seems that unique identifiability for the speaker plays no role (?).

Next, you use the terms ""particle"", ""function word"" and ""inflection"", but I'm not sure what exactly these mean. Would it be possible, instead, to use the term ""bound form"", i.e. a form that cannot occur on its own (= in isolation)? (see https://dlc.hypotheses.org/1779) Everyone agrees that ""inflectional markers"" cannot occur on its own, and this applies to most forms called ""particles"" as well (except for ""yes"", ""no"", and very few others). The most difficult concept is ""function word"" – but wouldn't you agree that definite articles are not expected to be free forms? It seems that in all languages, (at least some) demonstratives can occur on their own, while forms called ""definite articles"" can never occur in isolation.

If one had these definitions (which I'd hope would be widely acceptable), your question could be formulated as follows:

Are there glossed corpora of languages that lack bound forms that routinely mark definite nominals as definite?

(Or even more briefly: Are there glossed corpora of languages that lack a definite article? if ""definite article"" is defined as ""a bound form that routinely marks definite nominals as definite"".)

It seems to me that ""bound form"" is probably better suited than ""grammaticalized"", because this term is rather vague and there are a whole range of criteria that one might apply.

I'd be curious to hear what you think.

Best wishes,
Martin",,,,,,,,,,,,

Interjections are one of the traditional parts of speech (along with nouns, verbs, etc.), although some linguists have considered them not to be a part of language but rather instinctive reactions to a situation. The word interjection comes from the Latin interjicere “to throw between,” as they were seen as words that were tossed into a sentence, without being syntactically related to other items. Examples of English interjections are oh!, ah!, ugh!, and ouch! Interjections such as these, which are not (zero-)derived from words belonging to other parts of speech, and which have only an interjectional function, are called primary interjections; interjections that have evolved from words of other classes and which have retained their original function in addition to their new one are known as secondary interjections. Secondary interjections are often swear words, e.g. shit!, or religious terms, e.g. Jesus! Some (putative) interjections, interjectional phrases, consist of more than one word, e.g. my God!; they could be problematic for the view that interjections are a word class or part of speech. Interjections have received considerably less attention from linguists than the other parts of speech. This may be due, in part, to the just mentioned view that they are not really linguistic items and thus are of little or no interest from a linguistic point of view. However, to say that they have been neglected, as some authors do, is an overstatement; as can be seen in this article, scholars have been thinking and writing about different aspects of interjections for a long time (and note that this article mentions only works devoted (at least in large part) to interjections, not works on other subjects that also discuss interjections). Thus here one will see works on the phonetics/phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of interjections, among other subjects. There does, however, seem to be one gap in the literature: few, if any, papers focus on the morphology of interjections. A problem in compiling a bibliography on interjections is that authors disagree on what should be included in the set of interjections; for example, are onomatopoeias interjections (and thus should works on onomatopoeias be included in a bibliography on interjections)? In this article a conservative policy has been taken, and works dealing only with onomatopoeias (or greetings, etc.) have been excluded.",,,,,,,Interjection,http://linguistics-ontology.org/gold/2010/Interjection,"""An interjection is a part of speech, typically brief in form, such as one syllable or word, whose members are used most often as exclamations or parts of an exclamation.

When a personal pronoun is a bound person form (i.e. a person index), it can be called ""pro-index"".

##Or maybe pro-index should not be included???

Lingtyp 2021.07.07-ego:

Maybe the following will work:

""A personal pronoun is a free form that (i) denotes a speech role (speaker/producer and/or hearer/comprehender) OR that is used as an anaphoric form AND (ii) that can be used in a complement clause coreferentially with a matrix clause argument.""

This is a disjunctive definition that brings together locuphoric forms ('I', 'we', 'you') and 3rd-person anaphoric (or ""endophoric"") forms, following the Western tradition (but not following any kind of compelling logic).

It seems that personal pronouns need to be delimited from three types of somewhat doubtful forms:

– person indexes (I do not include bound forms under ""personal pronoun"" here, following my 2013 paper on person indexes: https://zenodo.org/record/1294059)
– demonstratives
– titles like ""Your Majesty""

I think that if a language has a form like ""that-one"" or ""your-majesty"" that can be used coreferentially in a complement clause, one will regard it as a personal pronoun:

(a) ""My sister(i) thinks that that-one(i) has an answer.""
(b) ""Does your-majesty(i) think that your-majesty(i) has an answer?""

In German, the polite second-person pronoun ""Sie"" (which has Third-Person syntax) can be used in (b), but the demonstrative ""die"" can hardly be used in (a), so it would not count as a personal pronoun (yet). However, in Hindi-Urdu and Mongolian, as mentioned by Ian, the demonstrative can be used in this way (I think), so it would count as a personal pronoun.

I don't think we need the general notion of ""person"" to define ""personal pronoun"". Wikipedia's current definition is therefore quite confusing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_pronoun).

Thanks for this interesting challenge, Ian! It seems to me that quite a few of our traditional terms CAN be defined, but their definitions are not obvious at all (and the textbooks don't usually give the definitions).

This definition would comprise forms such as Italian ""cosa"" (which means 'what?' or 'thing'), as well as French ""que"" (which is a bound form, in that it cannot occur by itself). Perhaps these are not ""genuine"" interrogative pronouns, in the sense that they are free forms (like Latin ""quid?""), or in the sense that they only occur in an interrogative context (again like Latin ""quid?""). But since even the forms of well-known languages may occur in non-interrogative contexts (e.g. most English wh-pronouns, used in relative clauses), it does not seem reasonable to define ""interrogative pronoun"" in a narrow sense.

110,applicative marker,APPL,An applicative marker is a grammatical marker occurring on a verb that changes the verb's valency in such a way that an argument other than the P of the base verb gets to be coded like the P-argument in a simple transitive clause.,"There are various subtypes of applicative markers, depending on the role which they transform into a P-argument. Thus, for example, an instrumental applicative marker is an applicative marker that transforms a nominal with an instrumental role into a P-argument, and languages often have benefactive or comitative applicative markers.

Polinsky (2005), Peterson (2007) and Pacchiarotti (2017) offer general cross-linguistically informed discussions of applicatives, and Pacchiarotti's Chapter 2 has extensive discussion of the terminology.

Many authors think of applicative constructions as containing an additional ""direct object"" of some kind, and then the question of the cross-linguistic identification of ""direct object"" arises. The definition in terms of ""P-argument"" (= coded like the monotransitive P) solves this problem.

Some languages have object-adding markers that indicate the addition (or mere presence) of a different kind of ""object"", e.g. a dative or oblique object, or even an adpossessor of an object.

158,applicative construction,APPLCON,(preliminary entry),"Lingtyp:

I think the answer to Adam's question is that a construction is an applicative only if the new object is coded like the P-argument of a basic transitive construction.

Thus, Simon Musgrave's example (1c) from Taba (based on Bowden 2001) is an (instrumental) applicative:

npun-ak kolay peda
kill-APPL snake machete

But when the instrument 'machete' has its instrumental preposition (ada peda 'with a machete'), it is not an applicative, from a typological perspective (= as a comparative concept).

There is no ""official"" definition of the (typological) term ""applicative"", of course, but it is my understanding that most people use the term in this way. The Wikipedia article reflects this by speaking about promotion to ""(core) object"": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_voice.

(Maria Polinsky's WALS article is vague and speaks just about ""increasing the number of object arguments by one"", without making precise what is meant by ""object"", https://wals.info/chapter/109. But her examples and the discussion make it clear that she means objects coded like P-arguments.)

This does not mean, of course, that the description of Taba should not use the term ""Applicative"" for the suffix -ak in all cases – but this would be a language-specific descriptive category, somewhat like Dative is used in Russian-type languages also when the case in question is not used in its definitional function (recipient of 'give').",,,,,,,,,,,,

194,anaphoric form,,An anaphoric form is a form which always receives its referential interpretation from another expression in the context.,"[Long quote from LINGTYP 2021.05.21:]

It seems to me that this example (Korean Hyeng-kwa hyeng-uy chinkwu 'older brother and his friend') should not be subsumed under ""anaphora"".

I think the term ""anaphoric form"" should probably be defined as follows:

An anaphoric form is a form which always receives its referential interpretation from another expression in the context.

(One might also say ""anaphor"" instead of ""anaphoric form"", but in generative grammar's ""binding theory"", anaphor is often used for a special subset of anaphoric forms.)

A noun or nominal which is not an anaphoric form is typically banned from being coreferential with another element in the same minimal clause (*Kim(1) went home with Kim(1)'s friend). But with titles and kinship terms, and in some languages also names, such coreference is often possible (e.g. Vietnamese
Đạti nghĩ là Đạti sẽ thắng [Dat think that Dat will win], Pham 2011: http://www.mikettpham.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kinship-terms-squib.pdf). So there is something special going on here.

Are such forms (which are not anaphoric forms by definitions) pronouns? This depends on how we define ""pronoun"", but I would think that pronouns should not be an open class. So we probably need some new terms here. Maybe something has been proposed in the literature on East/Southeast Asian languages?

Best,
Martin

Ian Joo:

Dear all,

is there a term for “non-pronominal anaphora”, i. e. using personal names or titles for anaphoric reference?
Example:

    Hyeng-kwa hyeng-uy chinkwu
    older.brother-COM older.brother-GEN friend
    `Older brother and his (lit. older brother’s) friend’ (Korean)

I tried to search it in Google, but since I don’t know what this phenomenon is called, I don’t know what to search for.
I would appreciate your help.

Regards,
ian",,,,,,,,,,,,

323,locational clause,,A locational clause (a cover term) is a predlocative clause or an existential clause.,"Hengeveld (1992: 94) uses ""localizing (predicate)"" in the sense of a locational clause. The term ""locational (clause)"" was used prominently by Clark (1978) as a cover term both for locational clauses (including predlocative and existential) and for possessional clauses (including appertentive and predpossessive) (in Haspelmath 2024, the cover term for these four is ""locopossessional"").",,,,,location clause,"location clause (cxn): a clause in which a locative relation is expressed, either predicationally or presentationally.

Example: Russian u menja mašina [at me car] ‘I have a car’ is an instance of the locational possessive strategy. The locational possessive strategy essentially recruits a locative clause, in particular a presentational locative, to express possession. (Section 10.4.2)",,,,,,
326,locative comparative construction,,,,,,,,locative comparative,"locative comparative (str): a fixed-case strategy in comparative constructions in which there is a clause which attributes a gradable predicative scale to the comparee, and the standard is expressed as an oblique argument phrase using a spatial flag with a locative (‘on, at’) meaning. Example: Ubykh yi-gune wo-gune-n ca-qasaqa-j ‘This tree is taller than that tree’ is an instance of the locative comparative: yi-gune ca-qa- saqa-j asserts that this tree is bigger, and wo-gune-n expresses the standard, that tree, with a suffix -n meaning ‘on.’ (Section 17.2.2)",,,,,,

328,adpossessive construction,,,,,,,,possessive modification construction,"possessive (modification) (a.k.a. attributive possession) construction (cxn): the nominal modifier construction that expresses a possession relation such that the possessor is the modifier and the possessum is the head (i.e. is the referent expression). Example: Sally’s calendar is an instance of possession – the calendar could be one that she owns, one that she gave me, one that she is holding in a photo of people with calendars, one that she designed or made, one with photos of her, and so on. Many languages have two morphosyntactically distinct possessive modification constructions, an alienable possession construction and an inalienable possession construction (or constructions).

335,particle comparative construction,,,,,,,,particle comparative,"particle comparative (str): a derived-case comparative strategy that consists of two clauses which assert that the gradable predicative scale applies to the comparee and the standard, but the second clause uses the zero strategy for predicate identity, and the conjunction is a particle with diverse etymological origins. Example: Randy is older than Tom (is) is an instance of the particle strategy: the clause Randy is older is followed by the particle than which introduces the standard phrase Tom without its own predicate (only an optional auxiliary is).

372,anaphoric construction,,An anaphoric construction is a construction in which a referent is not expressed by a full nominal but in such a way that the interpretation must rely on another expression (the antecedent) in the context.,"Anaphoric constructions are sometimes contrasted with ""cataphoric constructions"" (or ""cataphoric uses"" of anaphoric forms) in which the antecedent follows the expression in which a referent is not expressed fully. However, ""anaphora"" is more often used more broadly, to encompass both situations. (For the broader sense, some authors use ""endophora."" To make the narrower sense clear, one could use ""exanaphora"", as ""exana-"" means 'again'.)

Anaphoric constructions often involve [anaphoric forms]°, but constructions such as [control constructions]° in which there need not be any form are also anaphoric.

Anaphoric constructions cannot be defined in terms of ""coreference of an expression with its antecedent"" because full nominals may be coreferential with full nominals in another clause (e.g. ""My mother was a teacher.

Examples: The grizzlies ate the salmon and The salmon were eaten by the grizzlies are instances of contrasting voice constructions, the basic voice construction and the nonbasic voice construction (specifically, the passive–inverse construction), which are appropriate in different discourse contexts, depending on whether the grizzlies or the salmon is the more salient participant at that point in the discourse.

383,long-distance reflexivizer,,,,,,,,long-distance reflexive,"long-distance reflexive (str): a strategy in which a reflexive pronoun is used where the referring phrase denoting the referent with which the reflexive pronoun is coreferential does not occur in the same clause (more or less; the precise definition of ‘local’ uses of the reflexive pronoun varies). In particular, in the context of this textbook, a reflexive pronoun is used in a logophoric construction. Example: in Japanese Takasi wa Taroo ni Yosiko ga zibun o nikundeiru koto o hanasita ‘Takasii told Taroo that Yosiko hated himi,’ the reflexive pronoun zibun in the utterance complement Yosiko ga zibun o nikundeiru koto o is coreferential with the speaker participant Takasi in the matrix clause.
