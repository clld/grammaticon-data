29,Inclusive/exclusive distinction in independent pronouns: Inclusive/exclusive,"For speakers of English (or any other European language), both the inclusive and the exclusive pronouns are to be translated as we. The difference between the two depends on the intended meaning. An inclusive pronoun necessarily includes reference to the addressee. For example, the Mandarin inclusive pronoun zámen means ‘we, I and you’; others can optionally be included. An exclusive pronoun, like the Mandarin pronoun wŏmen, excludes the addressee from the reference, resulting in a meaning like ‘I and some others, but not you’.",17,3,http://wals.info/chapter/39,039A-5

In most languages with possessive nouns, there is a small and closed set of nouns grammaticalized for such usage, and their semantics amounts to classification of possessive relations (so that possessive nouns are also referred to as possessive classifiers).""",31,3,http://wals.info/feature/58B,058B-3

51,Are there definite or specific articles? YES (1),"An article is defined as ""a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity and (in)definiteness (""identifiability"")"", but suprasegmental marking also counts. Definite articles often arise from demonstratives and form a continuum with them; to qualify as an article, a marker should be used in some cases to express definiteness without also expressing a spatial deictic meaning.",33,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB020,GB020-1
52,Definite article: Definite affix,,35,3,http://wals.info/feature/37A,037A-3
53,Do indefinite nominals commonly have indefinite articles? YES (1),"For this feature, we need explicit support that indefinite/non-specific NPs commonly occur with an indefinite/non-specific article. Three or more examples of indefinite/non-specific nominals occurring with an indefinite/non-specific article is sufficient to code 1.

An indefinite article is a marker that accompanies the indefinite noun and expresses notions such as non-specificity and indefiniteness. Sometimes these notions of non-specificity and indefiniteness are summed up in the term ‘identifiability’. A language does not necessarily have both a non-specific/indefinite and a specific/definite marker. These markers often stem from very different sources (numerals and demonstratives) and need not be similar in formal expression or position.

The formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone. Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm of markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum, making it hard to define discrete categories. Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often obligatory in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning ‘a certain’. As articles necessarily accompany nouns, it is in these cases that it is necessary to investigate whether the marker can occur independently or not; if it can it is most likely a pronoun and not an article. Articles can be homophonous with pronouns and demonstratives, and also with classifiers.

Procedure

• Code 1 if indefinite NPs commonly occur with an indefinite/non-specific article. Three or more examples are sufficient.
• Code 1 if there is evidence (three or more examples) of a demonstrative or numeral for 1 that has grammaticalized into an indefinite article. Look for explicit analysis from the author that they are indefinite articles or look at the environments in which they occur, for example, whether they occur in different positions depending on whether they are functioning as an indefinite article or not.
• Code 0 if there are no indefinite articles.
• Code 0 if there are less than three examples of indefinite/non-specific articles occurring with indefinite NPs and note this in the comments.
• Code ? if it is unclear whether there are indefinite articles due to limited analysis from the author or because there are not enough examples.",36,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB021,GB021-1
54,Are there prenominal articles? YES (1),"This feature is about definite or specific articles (as in GB020) and about indefinite articles (as in GB021), and it asks whether any such articles may precede the noun in ""the pragmatically unmarked order"".",37,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB022,GB022-1
55,Are there postnominal articles? YES (1),"This feature is about definite or specific articles (as in GB020) and about indefinite articles (as in GB021), and it asks whether any such articles may follow the noun in ""the pragmatically unmarked order"".",38,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB023,GB023-1
56,Can adnominal property words occur discontinuously? YES,"This means that a restrictively interpreted adjective is separated from the noun by some element that is not part of the nominal. For example, can you say ""The man is running big"" and the like to mean ""The big man is running"". Typically a language which allows this has extensive agreement systems so that you can still work out what modifies what in the NP without them being adjacent (i.e. the ""Australian type""). NPs that are made up of several coordinated NPs that can be interpreted by the verb or other elements are not relevant here. This features aims to capture NPs where the head and modifiers can be separated. Examples of the type ""I painted the house red"" or ""I saw the boy big"" are not necessarily discontinuous, but most likely resultative or contrastive (""I saw the boy big [as opposed to before when he was small]"").",39,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB026,GB026-1

305,Can adnominal property words occur discontinuously? NO,"This means that a restrictively interpreted adjective is separated from the noun by some element that is not part of the nominal. For example, can you say ""The man is running big"" and the like to mean ""The big man is running"". Typically a language which allows this has extensive agreement systems so that you can still work out what modifies what in the NP without them being adjacent (i.e. the ""Australian type""). NPs that are made up of several coordinated NPs that can be interpreted by the verb or other elements are not relevant here. This features aims to capture NPs where the head and modifiers can be separated. Examples of the type ""I painted the house red"" or ""I saw the boy big"" are not necessarily discontinuous, but most likely resultative or contrastive (""I saw the boy big [as opposed to before when he was small]"").",268,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB026,GB026-0
