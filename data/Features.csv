The formally possessed generic noun 'pet' is a more or less conventional choice in this construction.  Such nouns will be called possessive nouns here. ... In most languages with possessive nouns, there is a small and closed set of nouns grammaticalized for such usage, and their semantics amounts to classification of possessive relations (so that possessive nouns are also referred to as possessive classifiers).""",31,3,http://wals.info/feature/58B,58B-3

50,Are there definite or specific articles?: 0 (no),,34,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB020,20-0
51,Are there definite or specific articles?: 1 (yes),"An article is a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity, (in)definiteness and information status (new or given status). Sometimes these notions of specificity, definiteness and information status are summed up in the term ""identifiability"". Articles cannot occur independently, though they might be homophonous with pronouns or numerals that can. A language does not necessarily have both a non-specific/indefinite and a specific/definite marker. These markers often stem from very different sources (numerals and demonstratives) and need not be similar in formal expression or position. Formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone. Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm where there are markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum making it hard to define discrete categories. Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often obligatory in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning 'a certain'. As articles necessarily accompany nouns, it is in these cases that it is necessary to investigate whether the marker can occur independently or not; if it can it is most likely a pronoun and not an article. Articles can be homophonous with pronouns and demonstratives, and also with classifiers.
Procedure

    Code 1 if there is a conventionalised way of marking definiteness or specificity without marking spatial location, and if there is evidence that the marker in question is different in form from the spatial deictic demonstratives (e.g. ‘the’ is different from ‘that’).

    If no such marker is given, write ‘Not mentioned’ in the comment and code 0 if other demonstratives have been covered, otherwise code ‘?’.

52,Definite article: Definite affix,,35,3,http://wals.info/feature/37A,37A-3
53,"Do indefinite nominals commonly have indefinite articles?- 1 (yes)
","In this question we need explicit support that indefinite NPs cannot occur without an indefinite/non-specific article. Personal names are excluded here, they do not suffice for a 'yes' (1). Indefinite articles can be homophonous with demonstratives, the numeral 'one' or classifiers.
Procedure

    Code 1 if indefinite NPs cannot occur without an indefinite/non-specific article.
    Ignore personal names.
    If there is an example of an indefinite NP occurring without an article, then give the page reference and code 0.
    If no such marker is given, write ‘Not mentioned’ in the comment and code 0 if other demonstratives have been covered.",36,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB021,21-1

55,Are there postnominal articles?,,38,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB023,23-1
56,Can adnominal property words occur discontinuously?,"This means that a restrictively interpreted adjective is separated from the noun by some element that is not part of the nominal. For example, can you say ""The man is running big"" and the like to mean ""The big man is running"". Typically a language which allows this has extensive agreement systems so that you can still work out what modifies what in the NP without them being adjacent (i.e. the ""Australian type""). NPs that are made up of several coordinated NPs that can be interpreted by the verb or other elements are not relevant here. This features aims to capture NPs where the head and modifiers can be separated. Examples of the type ""I painted the house red"" or ""I saw the boy big"" are not necessarily discontinuous, but most likely resultative or contrastive (""I saw the boy big [as opposed to before when he was small]"").",39,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB026,26-1
