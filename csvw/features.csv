48,Number of possessive nouns: Two to four,"Bickel & Nichols (2005): ""The head noun 'chicken' is grammatically non-possessible, though as the example indicates its referent can be owned, showing that non-possessibility is a grammatical rather than a purely semantic property. The formally possessed generic noun 'pet' is a more or less conventional choice in this construction.  Such nouns will be called possessive nouns here. ... In most languages with possessive nouns, there is a small and closed set of nouns grammaticalized for such usage, and their semantics amounts to classification of possessive relations (so that possessive nouns are also referred to as possessive classifiers).""",31,3,http://wals.info/feature/58B,058B-3
51,Are there definite or specific articles? YES (1),"An article is defined as ""a marker that accompanies the noun and expresses notions such as (non-)specificity and (in)definiteness (""identifiability"")"", but suprasegmental marking also counts. Definite articles often arise from demonstratives and form a continuum with them; to qualify as an article, a marker should be used in some cases to express definiteness without also expressing a spatial deictic meaning.",33,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB020,GB020-1
54,Are there prenominal articles? YES (1),"This feature is about definite or specific articles (as in GB020) and about indefinite articles (as in GB021), and it asks whether any such articles may precede the noun in ""the pragmatically unmarked order"".",37,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB022,GB022-1
55,Are there postnominal articles? YES (1),"This feature is about definite or specific articles (as in GB020) and about indefinite articles (as in GB021), and it asks whether any such articles may follow the noun in ""the pragmatically unmarked order"".",38,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB023,GB023-1
62,Standard negation is a particle that precedes the verb,"The feature ""is set to yes if the negation marker has the following characteristics

• It precedes the verb it negates (precedes to be understood broadly not as 'immediately' precedes).
• It appears as a free form for the negation of a simple declarative clause.
• It does not admit any morphological marking typically associated with verbs in the language.""",45,5,http://sswl.railsplayground.net/browse/properties/482,Neg01
96,Is there an instrumental applicative marker on the verb (including indexing)? YES,"This question concerns a bound verbal marker that signals that the verb has an instrumental argument. The marker could be analysed in the language-specific case as voice, agreement or a bound pronoun. The marker doesn't have to index the instrument.",78,4,http://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB104,GB104-1
97,Is there an instrumental applicative marker on the verb (including indexing)? NO,"This question concerns a bound verbal marker that signals that the verb has an instrumental argument.
